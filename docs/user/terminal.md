# Terminal history

Each terminal keeps up to 5,000 lines and 8 MiB of scrollback in its workspace. T3 Coder removes the oldest output when either limit is reached. A long
line can be shortened at the start. New terminal output is not truncated.

These limits apply when you reconnect and when T3 Coder restores saved terminal
history. The browser can show less scrollback than the workspace keeps. After a short disconnect,
the terminal resumes from the output it missed instead of reloading its history.

Use Shift+PageUp and Shift+PageDown to read scrollback
without leaving terminal input. Ctrl+Shift+Home and Ctrl+Shift+End jump to the
start and latest output; use Cmd instead of Ctrl on macOS. Full-screen terminal
programs keep these navigation keys.

To copy all retained output, choose Select all in the terminal's context menu,
then copy. Cmd+A on macOS and Ctrl+Shift+A elsewhere select the same output.
Ctrl+A still moves to the beginning of shell input on Windows and Linux.
Jump to latest in the context menu returns to the current output.
